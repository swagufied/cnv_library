PDE4DIP	one of most frequently associated with immunodeficiency. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3277634/ - genes annotated as associated with immunodeficiency are not very good predictors of CVID genes. but compiling genes from immunodeficient studies are better predictor of CVID genes
HRNR	x
FCGR2C	Expression of FcγRIIc is dependent on SNPs in exon3 and intron7 of the FCGR2C gene, which in most individuals is a non-expressed pseudogene https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4301001/. FcyRs affect the humoral immune response and especially the production of antibodies of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) isotype result in a heightened susceptibility to infections

C4B_2	associated with immunodeficiency,  gene localizes to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region on chromosome 6.(genecard), MHC associated with CVID https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1905305/

ORM1	The specific function of this protein has not yet been determined; however, it may be involved in aspects of immunosuppression (need to find articles)
MRC1	need source. among its related pathways are Innate Immune System 
MIR511-2	plays role in immune response of macrophages. Also miR-511 and miR-147b have been associated with modulation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR)-mediated signaling and NF-κB activation. https://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00140.2013
